# Local event loops with core.async

Drawing a polyline in a local event loop with JavaFX and Clojure
core.async. Initially had an idea to combine mouse press and move
events with alts! but since JavaFX allows to observe events in a
single callback (as opposed to many in Swing) the idea slightly
watered down to a local event loop. Neat trial anyway.
